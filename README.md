    What is the image? 
    
    This mod is intended for the slow-paced strategic player and is mainly designed to be cool as opposed to balanced. While it's not intended to be wretchedly unbalanced, it is tilted when it comes to access to resources. A player in a warm region will completely outclass a tundra region player in the early game, and the odds will likely remain in their favor forever. Make sure you plan ahead.
